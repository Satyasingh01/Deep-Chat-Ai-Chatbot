## Important Note

**Before starting work on a new feature or making changes to our API**, please open a new issue first.  
This helps us to:

- Confirm that your idea aligns with our project's vision
- Ensure it's not something we're already working on internally
- Assess whether it's something we can realistically support or implement

Creating an issue first allows for better collaboration and helps avoid duplicated or misaligned efforts. Thank you!
